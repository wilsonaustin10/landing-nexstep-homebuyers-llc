# CRM Integration Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Prioritized Go High Level Over Zapier**
- Go High Level is now the primary CRM integration
- Zapier is optional (will be skipped if not configured)
- Form submissions will succeed if at least one integration works

### 2. **Updated API Routes**
Both `/api/submit-partial` and `/api/submit-form` now:
- Try Go High Level first
- Try Zapier second (if configured)
- Return success if either integration works
- Only fail if both integrations fail or none are configured

### 3. **Enhanced Go High Level Service**
- Automatically extracts location ID from JWT token
- Includes location ID in all API requests
- Proper error handling and retry logic

### 4. **Fixed Environment Variables**
- Set correct Go High Level endpoint: `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/contacts/`
- Your API key is already configured

## Testing

Your server is now running on port 3001. To test:

1. Open http://localhost:3001
2. Submit a test form
3. Check the server console for messages like:
   - "Successfully sent to Go High Level"
   - "Zapier webhook URL not configured, skipping Zapier integration"

## What's Working Now

✅ Form submissions will no longer fail due to missing Zapier webhook
✅ Go High Level integration is active and primary
✅ Location ID is automatically extracted from your API key
✅ Proper error handling ensures user experience isn't affected by CRM failures

## Next Steps

1. Test a form submission to verify Go High Level receives the data
2. If you want to also use Zapier, update the `ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL` in your .env file
3. Monitor the server logs for any API errors
