# Go High Level API Version Header Fix

## Issue Resolved
The error "version header was not found" occurred because Go High Level's API v2 requires a `Version` header in all requests.

## What Was Fixed
Added the required `Version` header to all API requests:
```javascript
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.apiKey}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Accept': 'application/json',
  'Version': '2021-07-28',  // ‚Üê This was missing
}
```

## Go High Level API Requirements
1. **Authorization**: Bearer token (your API key)
2. **Content-Type**: application/json
3. **Accept**: application/json
4. **Version**: 2021-07-28 (required for API v2)

## Additional Improvements
- Added detailed request/response logging
- Better error parsing and reporting
- Shows exact API error messages in logs

## Next Steps
1. Redeploy your application to production
2. Test form submission again
3. Check Vercel Function logs for detailed debugging info

## Debugging Output
The logs will now show:
- Request details (endpoint, locationId, body)
- Response status and headers
- Exact error messages from Go High Level

This should resolve the "version header was not found" error!
