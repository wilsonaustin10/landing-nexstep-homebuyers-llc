# Google Ads Conversion Tracking Fix

## üî¥ The Problem

Google Ads couldn't detect your conversion tag because:

1. **Wrong Conversion ID**: You were tracking conversion ID `17041108639` but Google Ads was looking for `17359126152`
2. **Wrong Conversion Label**: You had `fLFZCLzz-fkYELD4yf8p` but Google needed `c162CKD-jfIaEIj9vNVA`
3. **Missing Conversion Name**: Google Ads specifically monitors "Submit lead form" conversion

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

### 1. Added Correct Conversion Tracking
```javascript
// The conversion Google Ads is monitoring
window.gtag('event', 'conversion', {
  'send_to': 'AW-17359126152/c162CKD-jfIaEIj9vNVA',
  'value': 1.0,
  'currency': 'USD'
});
```

### 2. Updated Three Key Locations

1. **Form Submission** (`context/FormContext.tsx`)
   - Fires when form is successfully submitted
   - This is the primary conversion point

2. **Thank You Page** (`app/thank-you/page.tsx`)
   - Fires as backup when user reaches thank you page
   - Ensures conversion is tracked even if form submission tracking fails

3. **Analytics Utility** (`utils/analytics.ts`)
   - Added `trackLeadFormSubmission()` function for consistency

### 3. Fixed Script Placement
- Moved gtag scripts to `<head>` section
- Using standard `<script>` tags (not Next.js Script component)
- Removed client-side rendering that prevented Google from seeing tags

## üéØ How to Verify It's Working

### 1. **Test a Form Submission**
```javascript
// Run this in console to test conversion firing
if (window.gtag) {
  window.gtag('event', 'conversion', {
    'send_to': 'AW-17359126152/c162CKD-jfIaEIj9vNVA',
    'value': 1.0,
    'currency': 'USD'
  });
  console.log('Test conversion sent successfully');
}
```

### 2. **Check Google Ads**
1. Go to Google Ads ‚Üí Tools & Settings ‚Üí Conversions
2. Find "Submit lead form" conversion
3. Status should change from "Inactive" to "Recording conversions" after first real conversion

### 3. **Use Google Tag Assistant**
1. Install Chrome extension
2. Navigate to your site
3. Submit a test form
4. Tag Assistant should show:
   - Green status for tag
   - Conversion event firing

### 4. **Network Tab Verification**
1. Open Chrome DevTools ‚Üí Network
2. Filter by "google"
3. Submit form
4. Look for request containing `cv=1` and your conversion ID

## üìä Conversion Details from Google Ads

```
Conversion Name: Submit lead form
Domain: www.otwpropertybuyers.com
Conversion ID: 17359126152
Conversion Label: c162CKD-jfIaEIj9vNVA
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Deploy Changes**
   - Push to production
   - Clear any caches

2. **Test Live Form**
   - Submit a test lead
   - Check Google Ads after 3-4 hours

3. **Monitor Status**
   - Google Ads status should change from "Inactive" to "Active"
   - May take up to 24 hours for first conversion to register

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Don't Remove Old Conversions Yet**
   - Keep tracking both conversion IDs during transition
   - Remove old ones after confirming new one works

2. **Value and Currency**
   - Currently set to 1.0 USD
   - Adjust if needed for your business model

3. **Multiple Firing Points**
   - Conversion fires on form submission AND thank you page
   - This is intentional for redundancy
   - Google deduplicates conversions automatically

## üéâ Expected Result

Within 24 hours of deploying these changes:
- Google Ads will show "Active" status
- Conversions will start recording
- You'll see data in your campaigns
